# DynamicModelling6DOFManipulator
The aim of this project is to obtain permissible torques for the maximum payload of the ABB Robotics - IRB-140 manipulator using Inverse Dynamics 

Validation is performed for the developed framework by verifying the resulting torques with that observed in the SimMechanics model
